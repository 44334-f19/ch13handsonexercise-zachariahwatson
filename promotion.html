    <h2>Ways to promote your website</h2>
	<ul>
        <li>Consistenty updating your site will keep your site on top of the SEO stack. Search engines will prioritize websites that have been updated recently, and it also gives a reason for previous customers to come back.</li>
        <li>Submitting your site to various search engines will increase web traffic. When someone searches your name, they will get an info box on the side of the screen instead of just having you being part of the search result list.</li>
        <li>Incorporating social media into your site will increase follower interaction. People might come across your social media page, which in turn will lead them to your site.</li>
